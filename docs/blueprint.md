# **App Name**: Viagens-Fadex

## Core Features:

- Comprehensive Request Management: A streamlined interface for creating, viewing, editing, duplicating, and deleting multi-passenger travel requests.
- Intuitive & Validated Form Input: Smart forms provide real-time formatting for CPF and dates to guide the user, coupled with robust validation to ensure data integrity for passenger details, travel itineraries, and billing information before submission.
- Efficient Itinerary Creation: Features a dedicated "round trip" option that automatically creates a return leg by inverting the origin and destination, significantly speeding up the data entry process for common travel patterns.
- Integrated Document Attachment: Allows for the upload and management of multiple files (images, PDFs, etc.) per passenger, keeping all necessary documentation, such as passports or visas, directly associated with the relevant traveler.
- Live Document Preview: A dynamic preview pane renders a real-time visualization of the final request document, allowing users to see exactly how their data will appear before exporting.
- Multi-Format, One-Click Export: Provides robust, one-click functionality to export the complete travel request into professionally formatted PNG, PDF, and Excel documents for versatile sharing and archival needs.
- Request Duplication for Efficiency: Instead of AI-based suggestions, the system offers a practical "duplicate" feature, allowing users to instantly create a new, pre-filled request based on an existing oneâ€”ideal for team travel or recurring trips.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary/Background Color: A deep, near-black (`#000000`) to create a modern, focused, and immersive experience. This minimizes eye strain and allows UI elements to stand out.
- Text/Foreground Color: Clean white (`#FFFFFF`) for maximum contrast and readability against the dark background.
- Accent Color: Vibrant green (`#00DC82`) for interactive elements like buttons, links, and highlights. This color provides a high-tech, energetic feel and signifies positive or primary actions.
- Primary/Background Color: Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) for a clean, minimalist, and airy interface that feels approachable and easy to navigate.
- Text/Foreground Color: A strong, dark gray (`#111111`) instead of pure black to provide crisp readability without being overly harsh.
- Accent Color: The same vibrant green (`#00DC82`) is used for interactive elements to maintain brand consistency and add a fresh, modern touch to the clean background.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, neutral, highly-readable appearance in the forms and display of passenger data.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for the headers in order to highlight calls to action and export functions in an eye-catching but clearly readable format.
- Use minimalist icons from 'Lucide React' to represent actions and categories within the app.
- Use a grid-based layout for a responsive and organized presentation of data.
